Sprint 9 (Business Analysis) project

Project Description

-You’ve done an outstanding job in the TripleTen course, and you’ve been offered an internship in the analytics department at Showz, a company that sells event tickets. Your first task is to help optimize marketing expenses.

*You have access to:

-Server logs with data on visits to the Showz website from January 2017 to December 2018
-A file containing orders placed during that period
-Marketing spend statistics

************Your research goal***********

1. Understand how customers use the service

2. Identify when users start making purchases

3. Determine how much revenue each customer brings to the company

4. Find out when the revenue covers customer acquisition costs

************Project Instructions*****************

Step 1: Access and prepare the data for analysis

Store the visit, order, and cost data in variables

Optimize the data for analysis

Ensure each column has the appropriate data type

*********Data paths:***************

/datasets/visits_log_us.csv — visit logs

/datasets/orders_log_us.csv — orders data

/datasets/costs_us.csv — marketing costs

Step 2: Generate reports and calculate metrics

Visits:

How many users visit the site each day, week, and month?

How many sessions occur per day? (A single user can have multiple sessions)

What is the average session duration?

How frequently do users return?

Sales:

When do users start buying?
(In KPI analysis, it's important to measure the time between registration and conversion—i.e., when a user becomes a paying customer. For instance, if a user registers and makes a purchase on the same day, they would fall into the “Conversion 0d” category. If they purchase the next day, it's “Conversion 1d.” Any approach that allows you to compare conversion patterns across cohorts or marketing channels is acceptable.)

How many orders are placed over a given period?

What is the average purchase size?

How much revenue do users generate? (LTV)

Marketing:

How much was spent? (In total, by acquisition source, over time)

What was the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) per source?

How profitable were the investments? (ROMI)

Create visualizations to show how these metrics differ by device and ad source, and how they change over time.

Step 3: Write a conclusion
Make recommendations to the marketing team on how much to invest and where.

Which sources/platforms would you recommend?
Support your recommendations:

Which metrics did you focus on and why?

What conclusions did you draw after calculating those metrics?
